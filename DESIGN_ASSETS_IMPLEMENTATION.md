# Design Assets Implementation Guide

## Issue Resolution ✅

The app was temporarily reverting to default icons to fix the build error. The custom design assets are ready to be implemented once you create the PNG files.

## Current Status
- ✅ All SVG design files created in `assets/` folder
- ✅ Flutter configuration prepared (currently commented out)
- ✅ App themes and branding applied
- ✅ Build error resolved - app should run normally now

## To Implement Custom Design Assets

### Step 1: Create PNG Files from SVG
Convert these SVG files to PNG format:

```
assets/app_icon.svg → assets/app_icon.png (1024x1024px)
assets/splash_logo.svg → assets/splash_logo.png (512x256px)
assets/branding.svg → assets/branding.png (200x40px)
```

**Quick Online Conversion:**
1. Go to https://convertio.co/svg-png/ or similar
2. Upload each SVG file
3. Set the output resolution as specified above
4. Download the PNG files to the `assets/` folder

### Step 2: Enable Custom Assets
Uncomment these sections in `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
flutter_launcher_icons:
  android: "launcher_icon"
  ios: true
  image_path: "assets/app_icon.png"
  min_sdk_android: 21
  web:
    generate: true
    image_path: "assets/app_icon.png"
    background_color: "#0D1B2A"
    theme_color: "#415A77"
  windows:
    generate: true
    image_path: "assets/app_icon.png"
    icon_size: 48
  macos:
    generate: true
    image_path: "assets/app_icon.png"

flutter_native_splash:
  color: "#0D1B2A"
  color_dark: "#0D1B2A"
  image: assets/splash_logo.png
  image_dark: assets/splash_logo.png
  branding: assets/branding.png
  branding_dark: assets/branding.png
  
  android_12:
    image: assets/splash_logo.png
    color: "#0D1B2A"
    image_dark: assets/splash_logo.png
    color_dark: "#0D1B2A"
  
  web: true
  android: true
  ios: true
```

### Step 3: Update Android Manifest
In `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`, change:
```xml
android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher"
android:roundIcon="@mipmap/ic_launcher"
```
to:
```xml
android:icon="@mipmap/launcher_icon"
android:roundIcon="@mipmap/launcher_icon"
```

### Step 4: Generate Assets
```bash
flutter pub get
flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main
flutter pub run flutter_native_splash:create
flutter clean
flutter pub get
```

### Step 5: Test
```bash
flutter run -d YOUR_DEVICE_ID
```
