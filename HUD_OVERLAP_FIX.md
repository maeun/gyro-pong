# HUD Overlap Fix - Implementation Summary

## Issue
The HUD panel (score, level, settings) was overlapping with the game blocks, making them partially invisible.

## Root Cause
Both the HUD panel and blocks were positioned too close to the top of the screen with insufficient separation.

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Increased Block Area Top Margin
- **Before**: `topMargin = 40.0px` (same as HUD top position)
- **After**: `topMargin = 140.0px` (generous separation)

### 2. Updated Ball Physics Ceiling  
- **Before**: Ceiling at screen top (`ballRadius`)
- **After**: Ceiling at `130.0px` (below HUD panel)

### 3. Added Visual Debug Indicators
- **Cyan line**: Shows intended game area boundary at `135px`
- **Red line**: Shows actual block area start at `140px`
- These lines help verify the spacing is working correctly

## Layout Structure (Top to Bottom)
```
0px     - Screen Top
30px    - HUD Panel Start
~90px   - HUD Panel End (estimated)
130px   - Ball Physics Ceiling
135px   - Visual Game Boundary (cyan line)
140px   - Block Area Start (red line)
320px   - Block Area End (140 + 180 height)
...     - Free Play Area
Bottom  - Paddle Area
```

## Testing the Fix

When you run the app, you should see:
1. **Cyan line**: Marking the visual game boundary
2. **Red line**: Marking where blocks actually start
3. **Clear separation**: Between HUD and blocks

If blocks are still overlapping the HUD:
- The red line shows where blocks are positioned
- The cyan line shows the intended boundary
- There should be clear space between HUD and red line

## Verification Steps
1. Run: `flutter run -d R3CN9046H3T`
2. Look for the colored debug lines
3. Confirm blocks start below the HUD panel
4. If still overlapping, the `topMargin` value can be increased further

## Rollback Instructions
If the fix causes other issues, revert these values:
- Change `topMargin` back to `40.0`
- Change `ceilingY` back to `ballRadius`
- Remove the debug line drawing code

The debug lines can be removed once the positioning is confirmed to be working correctly.
