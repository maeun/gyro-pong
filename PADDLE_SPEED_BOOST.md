- **Sensitivity Multiplier**: `1.0` → `1.5` (+50% boost)
- **Lerp Factor**: `0.65` → `0.85` (+31% faster visual response)
- **Smoothing**: `0.1` → `0.05` (50% less lag)
- **Deadzone**: `0.05` → `0.02` (60% more sensitive to small movements)

### 2. Updated Preset Values (All Much Faster)

#### Low Sensitivity Preset
- **Before**: 120 sensitivity, 0.25 smoothing
- **After**: 200 sensitivity (+67%), 0.15 smoothing (40% less lag)

#### Medium Sensitivity Preset  
- **Before**: 200 sensitivity, 0.12 smoothing
- **After**: 350 sensitivity (+75%), 0.08 smoothing (33% less lag)

#### High Sensitivity Preset
- **Before**: 320 sensitivity, 0.05 smoothing  
- **After**: 500 sensitivity (+56%), 0.03 smoothing (40% less lag)

### 3. Settings Page Default
- **Default Sensitivity**: `200.0` → `350.0` (+75% faster for new users)

## Expected Results

### Speed Improvements:
- **~3x faster** overall paddle response
- **Instant response** to device tilt (minimal deadzone)
- **Reduced input lag** by 50%+ 
- **Smoother visual tracking** with higher lerp factor

### User Experience:
- ⚡ **Lightning-fast paddle movement**
- 🎯 **Precise control** for quick ball returns  
- 🏃 **No more sluggish feeling** - paddle keeps up with your tilts
- 🎮 **Competitive gaming speed** for advanced players

## Fine-Tuning Available

Users can still adjust settings in the Settings menu:
- **Sensitivity slider**: Now ranges to much higher values
